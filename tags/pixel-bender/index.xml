      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my fourth year, there was an assignment dealing with different types of denoising. One of them was black-white grain noise, so I made a shader that only resampled those pixels. I was quite impressed with the result.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I helped out with UW&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spacesoc.uwaterloo.ca/rover/&#34;&gt;Mars Rover team&lt;/a&gt;. One of the things I did was try to get a merged view of the webcams that were on the rover. Since there wasn&#39;t much time before the competition (and I had a huge workload during that semester), I didn&#39;t have time to try any fancy approaches (RANSAC), and approximated with an affine transform. This didn&#39;t end up being used for the rover, as anything other than the ground would diverge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking at a website with a &#34;louppe&#34; effect (disqus.com, the site has changed since then), so I wanted to try doing it with a shader. Then, I added a &#34;drop-off&#34; effect - it seemed aesthetically pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
